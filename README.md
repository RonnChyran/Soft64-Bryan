# Notice: #
This is not a fully funtional emulator, its work in progress, and only it runs a basic interpereter.  That means no RCP emulation yet until the CPU is functional and fully tested.

# What Works
* WPF hexadecimal editor works very nicely!
* Unified memory system seems to work nicely too
* Bootloader based on PJ64 and Mupen64P both work correctly
* JSON based configuration is easy to use
* Emulator thread management is simple and OOP, works good, and supports local debugger control
* MIPS interpreter works and executes some implemented common opcodes
* ELF will load and run, but its run environment is very loose, no SysV, etc
* Cartridge rom loader is complete pretty much with some nice methods to detect the rom format
* TLB cache looks good, but I doubt it will be used much
* Logging is awsome with Nlog, all great info printed in WPF richtextbox :)
* We got a tracelog to dump to a file to see how the MIPS executes

# Project Goals for revision 1 #
* Implement high level graphics system
* Implement high level audio system
* Basic controller support
* Full blown WPF based debugger system
* Implement HLE features into the RCP core
* Implement SRAM, and flash memory
* Fully working "Pure" interpreter
