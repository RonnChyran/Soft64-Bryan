* Have the TLB mapper check the valid address ranged 
  based on the ring mode since its not checked inside the TLB

* Implement emulated MIPS cache system: Cache lines, tagging, I-Cache and D-Cache, Dirty/Invalid cache line bits

* Implement exception handling, and interrupts

* Implement some ring mode security by checking if address is accessable under conditions
  of the selected ring mode

* Implement FPU processor

* Implement all CP0 functions and processor control

* Implement the extensions used by the RCP processor: 128-bit vector regs (MMX stuff), RSP/RDP ops / functions)
  - OpenCL could be used to accerate RSP / RDP vector operations
  - Find an alternative MMX based vector acceleration
