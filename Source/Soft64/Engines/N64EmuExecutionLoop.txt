This is based on other emulators to break down the order of things executed on the emulator loop

* Load Configurations
* Swap bytes when copying rom to memory
* Init emu memory
* Send "ROM opened" notification to plugins
* start the input backend event loop
* start the video graphics backend thread
* bind audio backend stuff
* init and connnect controllert stuff
* init fake eeprom code
* init fake flashram
* init fake sram
* init CPU hard
* init CPU soft
* Do CPU execute loop

CPU Execution Loop
* Clear delay slot
* Clear instruction counter (profiler)
* start instruction address at PC
* set next interrupt var to 624999 (bitmap, so 8 different interrupts)
* init interrupt logic
* CPU interpreter loop
	* Deocode and excute next instruction
