{"name":"Soft64","tagline":"N64 Emulator","body":"# Notice: #\r\nThis is not a fully funtional emulator, its work in progress, and only it runs a basic interpereter.  That means no RCP emulation yet until the CPU is functional and fully tested.\r\n\r\n# Donations\r\nIf you want to support Soft64 to see the best N64 emulator written, I will take donations at [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=9FCF7548VCMRA&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)\r\n\r\nThe more donations I recieve, the more time I can afford and build a developer team.\r\n\r\n# What Works\r\n* WPF hexadecimal editor works very nicely!\r\n* Unified memory system seems to work nicely too (its thread safe too!)\r\n* Bootloader based on PJ64 and Mupen64P both work correctly\r\n* JSON based configuration is easy to use\r\n* Emulator thread management is simple and OOP, works good, and supports local debugger control\r\n* MIPS interpreter works and executes some implemented common opcodes\r\n* ELF will load and run, but its run environment is very loose, no SysV, etc\r\n* Cartridge rom loader is complete pretty much with some nice methods to detect the rom format\r\n* TLB cache looks good, but I doubt it will be used much\r\n* Logging is awsome with Nlog, all great info printed in WPF richtextbox :)\r\n* We got a tracelog to dump to a file to see how the MIPS executes\r\n\r\n# Project Goals for revision 1 #\r\n* Implement high level graphics system\r\n* Implement high level audio system\r\n* Basic controller support\r\n* Full blown WPF based debugger system\r\n* Implement HLE features into the RCP core\r\n* Implement SRAM, and flash memory\r\n* Fully working \"Pure\" interpreter\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer #\r\nYou agree to the Soft64 terms when you run Soft64.
